This document outlines the testing strategy for the [Project Name] project, including types of tests, test plans, and how to run tests.

## 1. Types of Tests

**Types of Tests to be Implemented:** [Describe the different types of tests that will be used in this project and their purpose.]
* **Unit Tests:** [Purpose of unit tests. e.g., testing individual components and functions in isolation.]
* **Integration Tests:** [Purpose of integration tests. e.g., testing interactions between different components.]
* **Performance Tests:** [Purpose of performance tests. e.g., measuring performance metrics and identifying bottlenecks.  Especially relevant for Apple Silicon optimization.]
* **End-to-End Tests (Optional):** [Purpose of end-to-end tests. e.g., testing the complete workflow from input to output.]
* ...

## 2. Test Framework and Tools

**Testing Frameworks/Libraries:** [Specify the testing frameworks and libraries that will be used (e.g., `pytest` for Python).]
* [e.g., `pytest`]

**Test Runners and Configuration:** [Describe how tests are run, any configuration settings, and any helper tools used for testing.]
* [e.g., `uv run pytest tests/` command to run pytest tests]
* [Configuration file locations (if any)]

## 3. Test Plan (High-Level)

**Test Plan Overview:** [Provide a high-level plan for testing different parts of the system. What components will be tested first? What are the priorities for testing?]
* [Testing Priority 1: e.g., Core components like PDF Processor]
* [Testing Priority 2: e.g., Data processing pipeline]
* ...

**Test Data and Environments:** [Describe where test data is stored, and any specific environments used for testing (e.g., development environment, CI environment).]
* [Location of test data]
* [Description of test environments]

## 4.  Running Tests

**Instructions for Running Tests:** [Provide clear instructions on how to run the tests. Include example commands and any prerequisites.]

**Example Command to Run Unit Tests:**
```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit/
